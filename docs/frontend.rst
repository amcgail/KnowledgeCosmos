Frontend Documentation
=====================

The frontend of the Knowledge Cosmos provides an interactive visualization interface for exploring academic papers in 3D space. This document covers the architecture, components, and features of the frontend system.

Core Components
-------------

Viewer (viewer.js)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Viewer`` class is the main visualization component that handles the 3D rendering and camera management:

* **Initialization**
    - Sets up the Potree viewer with WebGL rendering
    - Configures lighting, camera, and initial view settings
    - Initializes Eye Dome Lighting (EDL) for better depth perception
    - Sets up render loop and frame management

* **Camera Controls**
    - Perspective camera with configurable FOV (default 60Â°)
    - Orbit controls for rotation and panning
    - Dynamic movement speed based on camera distance
    - Keyboard navigation (WASD/Arrow keys)

* **Visualization Features**
    - Point cloud rendering with configurable point budget (500,000 points)
    - Ambient and directional lighting for proper 3D shading
